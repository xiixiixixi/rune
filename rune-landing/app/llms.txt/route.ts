## Key Features

### Capture
- Region, fullscreen, and window screenshot via native macOS screencapture CLI
- Screen recording with ScreenCaptureKit — pause, resume, discard controls
- Configurable recording: FPS (24/30/60), cursor visibility, audio capture
- OCR text extraction (Apple Vision framework)
- Color picker — sample any on-screen pixel, copies hex to clipboard
- Self-timer countdown overlay (3s, 5s, 10s)
- Customizable global keyboard shortcuts (⌘⇧3, ⌘⇧4, ⌘⇧5, ⌘⇧2, ⌘⇧O, ⌘⇧C)

### Beautify
- Backgrounds: 12 solid color presets, 16 gradient presets, bundled macOS wallpapers, custom images
- Effects: padding, corner radius, shadow strength — all rendered live
- Layout: aspect ratio (Auto, 1:1, 4:3, 3:2, 16:9, 9:16), 9-point alignment grid with smart corner radius
- Video editor: trim, crop, and beautify recordings with the same effects pipeline
- Export as PNG or JPEG for screenshots, MP4 for recordings

### Annotate
- Tools: rectangle, filled rectangle, ellipse, line, curved arrow, freehand, text, numbered badge, blur, spotlight
- Single-key shortcuts for each tool (R, F, O, L, A, D, T, N, B, G)
- Text annotations with font selection, size, bold, italic, underline, alignment
- Blur/pixelate redaction with adjustable density

### Workflow
- Floating preview overlay after capture — click to open editor
- Pin screenshots as always-on-top floating windows
- Capture history — browse and re-open past captures
- In-app updates — check, download, and install from the About tab
- Toast notifications for save, copy, OCR, and color picker feedback
- Configurable overlay position and auto-dismiss timing
